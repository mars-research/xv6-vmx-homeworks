 * This header is the "vocabulary" of the hypervisor: the MSRs that
 * report what the CPU supports, the bits of the VMCS control fields
 * that select which guest actions cause a VM exit, and the numeric
 * encodings used to name each VMCS field in VMREAD/VMWRITE.
 *
 * The VMCS (Virtual-Machine Control Structure) is a 4 KB, CPU-defined,
 * opaque memory region. Software never reads or writes it with normal
 * loads and stores; it uses VMREAD/VMWRITE with a 32-bit "field
 * encoding" that names the field. The VMCS has six groups of fields
 * (SDM 27.4-27.9):
 *
 *   guest-state area   loaded on VM entry, saved on VM exit
 *   host-state area    loaded on VM exit (where the hypervisor resumes)
 *   VM-execution       what the guest may do without causing an exit
 *     control fields
 *   VM-exit control    how an exit behaves
 *     fields
 *   VM-entry control   how an entry behaves
 *     fields
 *   VM-exit            read-only: why the last exit happened
 *     information
 *
 * Which header defines what: this file is only used by the kernel
 * (vmx.c); vmxapi.h is shared with user programs.
