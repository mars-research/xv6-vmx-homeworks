// System calls for the hypervisor in vmx.c.
//
// This file is the thin boundary between user space (runvm.c) and the
// hypervisor proper. Each sys_* function below is called by the
// system call dispatcher in syscall.c (see the table indexed by
// SYS_vmcreate, SYS_vmsetreg, SYS_vmgetreg and SYS_vmrun in syscall.h). It does
// only two things:
//
//   1. fetch the arguments from the user's saved registers and check
//      them, and
//   2. call the real implementation in vmx.c (vmcreate, vmsetreg,
//      vmrun), which does the work and returns the result.
//
// Argument passing. A system call takes no C arguments: the
// dispatcher calls sys_*(void). User space put its arguments in the
// registers rdi, rsi, rdx, rcx, r8, r9 (in this order) and the trap
// handler saved them in the process's trap frame, myproc()->tf. The
// helpers in syscall.c read argument number n from there:
//
//   argint(n, &i)        n-th argument as a 32-bit int
//   argint64(n, &i)      n-th argument as a full 64-bit value
//   argptr(n, &p, size)  n-th argument as a pointer to size bytes
//
// All three return 0 on success and -1 on failure. The wrappers
// below follow the xv6 convention: if any fetch fails, return -1 to
// the user without calling the hypervisor. The return value of a
// system call is placed in the user's rax, so -1 as a uint64 is
// "all ones" and a user program sees it as the int -1.
//
// User pointers. xv6 kernel code runs on the same page table as the
// calling process, so the kernel can dereference a user pointer
// directly, but it must first make sure the pointer lies inside the
// process's address space (below myproc()->sz). Otherwise a
// malicious or buggy program could pass a kernel address and trick
// the kernel into reading or overwriting its own memory. argptr()
// performs that check for a whole block of 'size' bytes: the start
// and the end must both be inside [0, sz), and size must not be
// negative.

// int vmcreate(void *image, int len, int memsz)
//
// Create a VM with memsz bytes of guest-physical memory and copy the
// len-byte guest image to guest-physical address VM_LOAD_ADDR.
// Returns a VM id (a small non-negative number) or -1.
//
// The image pointer is a user pointer, and the kernel will read len
// bytes from it, so argptr() must check that all len bytes lie in
// the caller's address space. That makes the length (argument 1)
// necessary before the pointer (argument 0) can be validated, which
// is why the arguments are fetched out of order: len first, then
// the pointer using len as the size. A negative len is rejected by
// argptr() itself. memsz is only a number here (the guest's memory
// is kernel memory, not a user buffer); vmcreate() in vmx.c checks
// that it is in range (0 < memsz <= VM_MAXMEM) and large enough
// to hold the image. The '||' chain stops at the first failure.

// int vmsetreg(int vm, int reg, uint64 val)

// (vmxapi.h). Returns 0, or -1 if the VM does not exist (or is not
// owned by the caller's process) or reg is out of range; those
// checks are made by vmsetreg() in vmx.c, not here.
//
// No user memory is involved: all three arguments are values. The
// register value is a full 64 bits (guest RIP and RSP are 64-bit
// addresses), so it is fetched with argint64(), not argint(), which
// would truncate it to 32 bits. vm and reg are small and fit in an

//
// The pointer argument is an output. On return vmrun() overwrites the

// sizeof(struct vmexit) bytes through the user pointer, and argptr()
// checks exactly that range. A pointer that is in the user address
// space but only partly (near the top of sz) is rejected, because the
// check covers the end of the block as well as its start.
