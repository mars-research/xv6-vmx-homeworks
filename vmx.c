/*
 * A minimal VT-x hypervisor.
 *
 * References: Intel SDM Volume 3 (System Programming Guide, order
 * number 325384-092, June 2026), chapters 26-33.  The pieces used
 * here are: ch. 26 (introduction to VMX), ch. 27 (the VMCS), ch. 28
 * (VMX non-root operation), ch. 29 (VM entries), ch. 30 (VM exits),
 * ch. 31 (EPT and the TLB), ch. 33 (VMX instruction reference), and
 * Appendix A-C (capability MSRs, VMCS field encodings, exit reasons).
 *
 * vmxinit() turns on VMX operation on each CPU at boot.  User programs
 * create and run VMs with the vmcreate, vmsetreg and vmrun system
 * calls (sysvmx.c), in the style of KVM: the kernel handles the exits
 * it must (host interrupts, EFER accesses) and returns every other
 * exit to the user program, which emulates the device or stops.
 *
 * Terminology.  The "host" is xv6 itself (VMX root operation); the
 * "guest" is the code run by VMLAUNCH (VMX non-root operation).  The
 * processor switches between them in hardware: a "VM entry" loads the
 * guest state area of the VMCS, and a "VM exit" saves the guest state
 * back to the VMCS and loads the host state area.
 *
 * A VM has one vCPU, a VMCS, and guest-physical memory backed by EPT.
 * The guest starts in 32-bit protected mode with paging off, which
 * needs the "unrestricted guest" control; the guest's own trampoline
 * switches to 64-bit mode.
 *
 * To keep things simple, a VMCS is loaded (VMPTRLD) only around each
 * VM entry and cleared (VMCLEAR) right after the exit, before host
 * interrupts are re-enabled.  The process may then be rescheduled on
 * any CPU, and every entry is a VMLAUNCH.
 *
 * Life of a VM, in terms of the functions below:
 *
 *   vmcreate()  allocate VMCS + EPT + guest memory, copy the image in,
 *               fill the VMCS (vmcsinit)
 *   vmsetreg()  set the initial guest registers (RIP, RSP, ...)
 *   vmrun()     loop: load VMCS, write host state, VMLAUNCH (vmx_enter
 *               in vmxasm.S), guest runs, VM exit lands in vmx_exit,
 *               read the exit information, VMCLEAR, handle the exit
 *               (vmxhandle) or return it to user space
 *   exit()      calls vmxfreeproc() to free the process's VMs
