/*
 * runvm: run a guest image from the file system in a VT-x VM.
 *
 *   runvm image [memory-MB]
 *
 * Loads the image at guest-physical VM_LOAD_ADDR, starts the guest
 * there, and emulates the guest's serial port: bytes the guest writes
 * to COM1 appear on the console. Stops when the guest halts.
 *
 * ROLE OF THIS PROGRAM
 *
 * runvm is the "virtual machine monitor" (VMM) in user space. It plays
 * the role that QEMU plays on top of KVM. The split of work is:
 *
 *   - The kernel (vmx.c) does the privileged part: it owns the VMCS and
 *     the EPT, executes VMLAUNCH, and handles the few VM exits that
 *     only the kernel can handle (host interrupts, the WRMSR to EFER).
 *   - This program does everything else: it decides what the guest
 *     image is, where it starts, and what the guest's "hardware"
 *     looks like. Here the only device is a transmit-only COM1 serial
 *     port.
 *
 * The control flow is the same as in any KVM-based monitor:
 *
 *   vmcreate()   allocate a VM and copy the image into guest memory
 *   vmsetreg()   set the guest's initial registers (here, only RIP)
 *   loop:
 *     vmrun()    enter the guest; returns when the guest does something
 *                the kernel cannot handle by itself (a "VM exit")
 *     inspect struct vmexit, emulate the event, go around again
 *
 * Whenever the guest executes an instruction that the hypervisor
 * configured to trap (OUT/IN, HLT, ...), the CPU leaves guest mode and
 * vmrun() returns here with the reason in struct vmexit (vmxapi.h).
